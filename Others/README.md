# Miscellaneous Instructions

This folder contains files related to general assembly language concepts, including address modes and constants.

## Files

- **address_modes.asm**: Explains the different addressing modes used in assembly to access data in memory.
- **constants.asm**: Demonstrates the use of constants in assembly programs.

### Key Concepts

- **Addressing Modes**: These are methods used by the CPU to access data in memory. Common modes include direct, indirect, and indexed addressing.
- **Constants**: Constants are values that do not change during program execution. They are often used to represent fixed data like sizes, limits, or flags.

These concepts are foundational for writing efficient and effective assembly programs.
