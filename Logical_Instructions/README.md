# Logical Instructions

This folder contains examples of logical operations in assembly language, which operate on binary data. Logical instructions are vital for bitwise manipulation, control flow, and setting flags.

### Key Concepts

- **AND**: The `AND` instruction performs a bitwise AND operation between two operands.
- **OR**: The `OR` instruction performs a bitwise OR operation between two operands.
- **XOR**: The `XOR` instruction performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation, which is often used for toggling bits.
- **NOT**: The `NOT` instruction inverts the bits of a register or memory location.

These logical operations are essential for low-level bit manipulation.
