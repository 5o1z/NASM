# Arithmetic Instructions

This folder contains assembly programs demonstrating basic arithmetic operations. Arithmetic instructions are fundamental for performing calculations and manipulating numeric data in assembly language.

## Files

- **AI1.asm**: Demonstrates basic addition of two numbers.
- **AI2.asm**: Performs subtraction of two numbers.
- **AI3.asm**: Implements multiplication of two numbers.
- **AI4.asm**: Shows division of two numbers.

### Key Concepts

- **Addition**: The `ADD` instruction adds two operands and stores the result in the destination operand.
- **Subtraction**: The `SUB` instruction subtracts the source operand from the destination operand.
- **Multiplication**: The `MUL` and `IMUL` instructions are used for multiplication. `IMUL` is for signed multiplication.
- **Division**: The `DIV` instruction divides the accumulator register by the source operand, with the result stored in the accumulator and the quotient.

These operations are essential for performing numerical computations in assembly.
